## Head

> **Note:** You can find a list of everything at [joshbuchea/HEAD](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

[x] **Doctype:** The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

[x] **Viewport:** The viewport is declared correctly.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

[ ] **Canonical:** Use `rel="canonical"` to avoid duplicate content.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com" />
```

### Social meta

**_Facebook OG_** and **_Twitter Cards_** are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

[ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended.

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page.html" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Content Title" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name" />
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />
```

These tags are optional but recommended

> **Notes:** Using `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

```html
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />
```

## HTML

### Best practices

[ ] **HTML5 Semantic Elements:** HTML5 Semantic Elements are used appropriately (header, section, footer, main, etc...)

> #### **Links**
>
> -   [HTML Reference](http://htmlreference.io/)

[ ] **Unique ID:** They must be unique.

[ ] **JS Prefix:** All classes / ID begin with **js-** and are not styled into the CSS files.

```html
<div id="js-slider"></div>
<div class="js-slider my-slider"></div>
```

[ ] **Error Pages:** Error 404 page and 5xx exist.

### HTML testing

[ ] **W3C Compliant:** All pages need to be tested with the W3C validator to identify possible issues in the HTML code.

> #### **Links**

## Images

> **Notes:** For a complete understanding of image optimization, check the free ebook **[Essential Image Optimization](https://images.guide/)** from Addy Osmani.

### Best practices

[ ] **Optimization:** All images are optimized.

[ ] **Srcset:** Use srcset to provide the most appropriate image for the current viewport of the user.

[ ] **Retina:** You provide layout images 2x or 3x, support retina display.

-   [ ] **Width and Height:** ![High][high_img] Set `width` and `height` attributes on `<img>` if the final rendered image size is known (can be omitted for CSS sizing).

-   [ ] **Alternative text:** ![High][high_img] All `<img>` have an alternative text which describes the image visually.

-   [ ] **Lazy loading:** ![Medium][medium_img] Images are lazyloaded (A noscript fallback is always provided).

-   [ ] **`noscript` tag:** ![Medium][medium_img] Use `<noscript>` tag in the HTML body if a script type on the page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser. This will be helpful in client-side rendering heavy apps such as React.js, see [examples](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-noscript-element--cms-25498).

```html
<noscript> You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. </noscript>
```
